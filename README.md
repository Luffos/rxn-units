Viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax, percentage) + useUnits hook<br/>for React, React Native and Expo.

Inspired by: [react-native-viewport-units](https://github.com/jmstout/react-native-viewport-units) and [react-native-expo-viewport-units](https://github.com/joetakara/react-native-expo-viewport-units)

##  Install

Using NPM
```sh
npm install rxn-units
```

Using Yarn
```sh
yarn add rxn-units
```
<br/> üåê Using this module for Web?<br/>Don't forget to setup [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)

##  Examples

- Using dynamical hooks: [CodeSandbox Example ‚òÅÔ∏è](https://codesandbox.io/s/rxn-units-example-ox6n4h)

## Units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax and percentage)
**What is vw? (viewport width)**<br/>
The `vw` measurement is equal to 1/100 of the viewport, window or screen width.
Example: If the browser width is 900px, `vw(1)` equals 9px.
<br/>

**What is vh? (viewport height)**<br/>
The `vh` measurement is equal to 1/100 of the viewport, window or screen height.
Example: If the browser height is 500px, `vh(1)` equals 5px.
<br/>

**What is vmin and vmax?**<br/>
- `vmax(n)` means `"Which is the larger between vw(n) and vh(n)?"` = `vw(n) or vh(n)`
- `vmin(n)` means `"Which is the lower between vw(n) and vh(n)?"` = `vw(n) or vh(n)`

**Percentage**<br/>
`percentage(x, y)` = `X%` of `Y`
<br/>

##  Usage

Using via hook (dynamically changes)

    import React from 'react';
    import useUnits from 'rxn-units';
    
    const Test = () => {
	  const {vmin, vmax, vw, vh, percentage} = useUnits();

      . . .
    }
    
Using static methods (Need manual recall every time)

    import React from 'react';
    import {vmin, vmax, vw, vh, percentage} from 'rxn-units';
    
    const handleClick = () => {
        console.log("current vmin", vmin());
        console.log("current vmax", vmax());
    }
    
    . . .

 üí° Each unit should be used in different cases depending on the purpose or need. But keep in mind that for a responsive (non-adaptive) layout these units should suffice. Many video games, engines or graphics engines use the same scheme to create UIs or on-screen resources that must automatically follow rules regardless of resolution. Of course, in some projects things flow much better by combining the same technique with graphic elements that are different or disappear depending on the conditions but remember that if you create infinite breakpoints to "just don't let the element leave the screen" you may be missing the right unit calculations in your software. Everything here can be used to define size, dimension, scale and position. For better understanding look for our examples.
